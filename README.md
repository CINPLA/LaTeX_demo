LaTeX_demo
==========

A short demonstration on how to use LaTeX. Start by looking in the master_file.tex located in Main. Here all the chapters, the bibliography and the configuration file is read in order to output the finished pdf.

A recomended texteditor is [Texstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/), note that you will also need a tex distribution e.g. []MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) for Windows, [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/) for Mac and [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux.
